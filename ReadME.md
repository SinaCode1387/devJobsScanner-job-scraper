# devJobScanner Job Scraper

## Description
This repository contains two scripts designed to scrape job listings from a specified website. Users can input their desired job title, remote work preference, sorting preference, and choose how to save the output (CSV, TXT, or both).

## Scripts

### Script 1: `job_scraper_static.py`
- Scrapes job listings using the `requests` library and `BeautifulSoup`.
- Displays job details in the console.
- Saves job details in CSV and/or TXT format.
- Suitable for static page scraping.

### Script 2: `job_scraper_dynamic.py`
- Enhanced to use `SeleniumBase` for dynamic page interaction.
- Supports infinite scrolling to load more job listings.
- Users can specify the number of job listings to scrape.
- More robust handling of dynamically loaded content.

## Requirements

### Common Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `beautifulsoup4` library
